# Jeopardy! The Complete Saga App

## Purpose

This repository is dedicated to the development of the mobile iOS app Jeopardy! The Complete Saga. This app utilizes the format of the beloved gameshow Jeopardy! as well questions sourced from the fan-made [website](http://www.j-archive.com/listseasons.php) containing questions from prior episodes.

## Database

This app sources from a Firestore Database created through the `jarchive_scraper_firestore_category.py` script located inside of the associated [database repository](https://github.com/NilayPachauri/Jeopardy-The-Complete-Saga-Database) inside the `Firestore` folder. Scripts for DynamoDB are also included if Firestore does not meet the developer's requisites.
